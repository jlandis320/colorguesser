There are 141 named CSS colors -- how good are you at identifying them?

NOTE: 
You may be saying, "I heard there were 147 CSS color names!" Well, yes. There are 147 color NAMES but there are actually only 139 colors.
 
8 colors have duplicate names -- 
Aqua/Cyan
Fuschia/Magenta
DarkGrey/DarkGray
Gray/Grey
DimGrey/DimGray
LightSlateGrey/LightSlateGray
SlateGrey/SlateGray
DarkSlateGrey/DarkSlateGray

I included both aqua/cyan and fuschia/magenta but not the duplicate grays.
