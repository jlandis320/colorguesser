# Do you know Roy G. Biv? 

There are 141 named CSS colors -- how well do you know them?

If you want to test yourself in a timed environment, click start timer. Otherwise, click a category to get started. The paint swatch will display an unidentified color -- guess the name with the buttons below the paint swatch. If you're right, you'll hear a chime and your score will increase. If you're wrong, you'll hear a buzzer and no point. The game ends when you've guessed all 141 colors. 

<sub>NOTE: You may be saying, "I heard there were 147 CSS color names!" Well, yes. There are 147 color NAMES but there are actually only 139 colors. 8 colors have duplicate names -- Aqua/Cyan, Fuschia/Magenta, DarkGrey/DarkGray, Gray/Grey, DimGrey/DimGray, LightSlateGrey/LightSlateGray, SlateGrey/SlateGray, and  DarkSlateGrey/DarkSlateGray. I included both aqua/cyan and fuschia/magenta but not the duplicate grays. </sub>
